# TwinYields - Digital Twin for Supporting Smart Farming Operations

TwinYields research project at [Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)](https://luke.fi/en) aims to develop a digital twin to support smart farming operations. All developed software is available under open licences.

This website hosts documentation for Python packages developed in the project. The following packages have been developed so far:

* [farmingpy](https://github.com/TwinYields/farmingpy). Python library for Smart Farming data and modeling. Enables reading of ISOBUS task files, EO data from SentinelHub and interfacing APSIM simulation models.

* [twinyields](https://github.com/TwinYields/twinyields-python). Package to run the digital twin. Initializes the model and database. Retrieves sensor data and EO data and runs the model. The package is under active development and the API is not yet documented.


The software with first modelling results are described in our preprint:
